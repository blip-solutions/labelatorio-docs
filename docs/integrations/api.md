## Obtaining API token

To integrate with Labelator.io through the application programming interface (API), you will need to obtain an API token. This token is assigned to a specific user and all actions taken using this token are performed on behalf of that user.

To generate an API token, you can follow the steps outlined below:

1.  Navigate to the user settings section by clicking on the user avatar icon located in the top right corner of the interface.
2. Locate the "Generate API token" button and click on it.
3. Copy the generated token and store it safely




Once you have generated an API token, you can use it to access the Labelator.io API and perform various actions on behalf of the user associated with the token. Please note that it is important to keep your API token secure, as it grants access to your account and any actions taken using the token will be attributed to you.

:::note
Please note that the API token generated for your account is unique and cannot be retrieved if lost. It is important to store the token securely and handle it with care. When a **new token is generated** to replace a old one, **the old token will be invalidated** in the process.
